# Tic Tac Toe with AI Algorithms

This project is an implementation of Tic Tac Toe using Tkinter with an AI component that uses four uninformed search algorithms to play the game: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), Iterative Deepening Search (IDS), and Uniform Cost Search (UCS). 
**This project was developed as part of a college course on Intelligent Systems.** You can play as **X** while the computer, using one of the selected algorithms, plays as **O**.

## How to Play

1. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. Select an algorithm for the computer's moves by clicking one of the buttons labeled **DFS**, **BFS**, **IDS**, or **UCS** below the grid.
3. Click on a cell in the grid to make your move as **X**. The computer will respond with its move as **O** based on the chosen algorithm.
4. The game ends with a win or loss message once the conditions are met.

To reset the game, click the **New Game** button, and select a new algorithm if desired.
